In order to run the assignment, please click on Assignment2.py, and click run. You will then be prompted to select an image. Once you select the image,
Tthe GUI will pop up where you are able to apply filters. add noise to your image

The libraries that were used are:
    PyQT/sys: File exploer for loading image
    MatPlotLib: Only for GUI, no built in functions were used apart from creating GUI
    Numpy: Padding, helping wtih soem filter operations,
    PIL: Loading images

NOTE: I am aware that the Kuwahara filter takes awhile to load. My solution is more than likely not the optimal solution,
      but I did not have enough time to fix it.
